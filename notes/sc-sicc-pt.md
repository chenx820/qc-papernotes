## [Sideband Cooling of Small Ion Coulomb Crystals in a Penning Trap](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08518)

#### Key Points

- Two- and three-ion 40Ca+ ICCs in a Penning trap
  - Penning trap uses a strong magnetic field aligned with the trap axis ($\hat{B}=B\hat{z} $) and a static cylindrically-symmetric quadrupolar electric potentia.
    $$\phi=A(2z^2-\rho^2)$$
  - Ions cold $\to$ Ion Coulomb Crystal (ICC)

#### Results

- The occupation of the ground state of the axial modes is above 75% for the two-ion planar crystal
